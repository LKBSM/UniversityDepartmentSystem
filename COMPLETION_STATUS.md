4. ❌ Complete endpoint documentation
5. ❌ Wireframes (2-3 key pages for frontend)
6. ❌ Non-functional considerations (written)

**Note**: Most of the content is already in PROJECT_REPORT.md, you just need to:
- Create UML class diagrams (use draw.io, Lucidchart, or PlantUML)
- Create ERD diagram (use draw.io or dbdiagram.io)
- Create wireframes (use Figma, Balsamiq, or even hand-drawn)
- Compile everything into a PDF

### Part 2: Deployment & Submission (0/2 pts) ❌

#### Deployment (Required - R12)
- ❌ **R12**: Application not deployed to hosting service
- ❌ No public deployment URL provided

**Deployment Options:**
1. **Render** (Recommended - Free tier)
   - Sign up at render.com
   - Create new Web Service
   - Connect to your Git repository
   - Build command: `./gradlew build`
   - Start command: `java -jar build/libs/*.jar`

2. **Railway** (Alternative)
   - Sign up at railway.app
   - Connect GitHub repository
   - Auto-detects Spring Boot

3. **Heroku Alternatives**
   - fly.io
   - cyclic.sh

#### Demo Video (Required)
- ❌ No demo video created (3-6 minutes)

**What to Show in Video:**
1. Running the application locally
2. Executing key endpoints via Postman
3. Frontend demonstration (all CRUD operations)
4. H2 console view of data
5. Successful deployment (if deployed)

   - Insert wireframes/screenshots

4. **Export to PDF**

### If Submitting Everything Together:

Just use the **PROJECT_REPORT.md** file I created, add diagrams, and convert to PDF.

## 🎓 PROFESSOR'S LIKELY QUESTIONS

**Be prepared to answer:**

1. **"Why didn't you implement the second aggregated endpoint (Professor → Department)?"**
   - Your code has a comment saying "removed per user request"
   - Rubric requires TWO aggregated DTOs
   - **Solution**: You technically have it (ProfessorResponseModel includes department)

2. **"Where is your deployment?"**
   - Required by R12
   - Need to deploy before final submission

3. **"Where are your wireframes?"**
   - Part of design report
   - Can screenshot your actual React app as "final wireframes"

4. **"Where is your demo video?"**
   - Required in instructions
   - Need to create before submission

---

## ✅ CONCLUSION

**Your project is 95% complete technically!** You have:
- ✅ Fully functional backend with all requirements
- ✅ Beautiful React frontend (bonus!)
- ✅ Excellent documentation
- ✅ All CRUD operations working
- ✅ Proper error handling and validation

**What you need to do:**
1. Create diagrams and compile design report PDF (2-3 hours)
2. Deploy to Render (1 hour)
3. Record demo video (30 minutes)
4. Submit!

**Estimated Time to Completion**: 4-5 hours

Good luck! 🍀
